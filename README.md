# ngx-custom-datatable

`ngx-custom-datatable` is an Angular component for presenting large and complex data.  It has all the features you would expect from any other table but in a light package with _no external dependencies_. The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light; it doesn't make any assumptions about your data or how you: filter, sort or page it.

It was built for modern browsers using _TypeScript, CSS3 and HTML5_ and Angular `>=4.0.0`.
